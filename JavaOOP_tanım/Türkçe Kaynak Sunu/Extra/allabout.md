Java, a widely-used high-level programming language, is renowned for adhering to the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Here's a comprehensive overview of Java's key features within the context of OOP:

1. **Classes and Objects**: At the core of Java lies the concept of classes and objects. Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, each object representing a specific instance of the class.

2. **Encapsulation**: Java supports encapsulation, where data (attributes) and methods (functions) operating on the data are bundled within a class. Access to data is controlled through accessor (getters) and mutator (setters) methods, ensuring data integrity.

3. **Inheritance**: In Java, classes can inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from other classes, fostering code reusability and establishing hierarchical relationships among classes.

4. **Polymorphism**: Java enables polymorphism, allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. This flexibility in method invocation is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

5. **Abstraction**: Abstraction in Java involves hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features of an object. Abstract classes and interfaces facilitate abstraction, defining method signatures without implementations.

6. **Interfaces**: Java interfaces define a contract for classes to implement, containing method signatures without implementations. Multiple classes can implement interfaces, enabling shared behaviors and achieving polymorphism.

7. **Packages**: Java organizes classes and interfaces into packages, providing namespace management and enhancing modularity, code organization, and maintenance.

8. **Access Modifiers**: Java offers access modifiers (public, private, protected, default) to regulate accessibility of classes, variables, methods, and constructors. This ensures encapsulation and data hiding.

9. **Garbage Collection**: Java employs automatic garbage collection to manage memory efficiently. The JVM automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects no longer referenced, simplifying memory management for developers.

In summary, Java's robust support for OOP principles, combined with its platform independence, syntax familiarity, and automatic memory management, positions it as a powerful and flexible language for developing scalable and maintainable software systems.
